Purpose of the Application
The purpose of this Tamagotchi application is to entertain people who will be using our application. This application is made kids but even though one is not a kid can use it for fun. This application will allow users to learn how to actually take care of an actual pet because they will know when to feed, clean and play with the pet.

User Interface and the code

I used Android Studio to create this application as it is used to create mobile applications and it is easy to be used. I created the User Interface to be user friendly so that it does not confuse users when they use the app and its simplicity will get many users to be interested on the app. I had to figure out a way so that the application can give feedback to users immediately and be able to change pictures when the user presses a certain button.
 
 
This is how the app will show results when the code is ran and this is how the user will see the app when he/she plays the app.
 
.Utilization of GitHub and GitHub action
I used GitHub to manage my code so that even if something wrong happen I can be able to get the code from GitHub and it did allow me to make changes without worrying about problems that may occur while I am editing the app. It made things easier for me to organise and to track the changes I made over time and maintain them. I got no difficulty updating changes and making adjustments to my code quickly. This simplified things for me and the project I was working on. It allowed me to experiment with new code lines without altering my existing code, preventing me from making unintentional mistakes or causing previously functional code to stop working due to unanticipated issues. I could make distinct files to test new files and address faults without having to worry about damaging everything thanks to it. I could update my modifications back into the code if the procedure for upgrading went well. What I love mostly about GitHub is that it allows users o be able to work together on the same project therefore it makes work easier.
